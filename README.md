## logseq-randomest-note 

Serendipity results from the ability to identify ‘matching pairs’ of events, or events that are meaningfully, even if not necessarily causally, related. But for that you need some guided randomness in your graph.

### Usage

- `git clone https://github.com:QWxleA/logseq-randomest-note.git`
- open Logseq Desktop client and turn on `Developer mode` in the user settings panel (`Esc t s`)
- open the toolbar dot menu and navigate to the plugins page (`Esc t p`)
- click `Load unpacked package` button, then select the `logseq-random-note` directory

Under **Settings** (which can be found on the plugin's card in the left lower corner):

- *Include journals* will show any page *or* journal as a random page
- *Show entire graph or tagged pages* makes it possible to limit the choice to only **pages** with a specific tag
- *Specific tag to search* tag to limit the search to. These are page tags: (`tags::` straight under the title)

### Notes

This plugin is a partial rewrite of [TankCool/logseq-random-note: Random walk through your Logseq notes.](https://github.com/TankCool/logseq-random-note). All mistakes are wholly mine.

As Logseq already has [Logseq Heatmap Plugin](https://github.com/pengx17/logseq-plugin-heatmap) and [Logseq journals calendar](https://github.com/xyhp915/logseq-journals-calendar), probably not a bad idea to skip the journal pages when we random walk through our notes.
